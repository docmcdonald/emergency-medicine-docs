     Assessment:
       {{ap}} Primary Delayed Ejaculation (likely at least partly secondary to serotonergic medication]
       Primary delayed ejaculation is difficult to treat unless directly related to a medication.
       If a medication cause is suspected, strategies include:
       1) Switching SSRI to vilazodone (Viibryd) or low dose vortioxetine (Trintellix)
       2) Switching SSRI to SNRI - duloxetine (cymbalta) or levomilnacipran (Fetzima) likely best
       3) Adding mirtazapine (Remeron) or bupropion (Wellbutrin) to an SSRI

       If not medication related, it is usually related to anxiety, and overcontrolling or obsessive personality traits.
       Intensive counselling may be helpful.

       Most men are able to find specific stimuli when alone that help them reach their particularly high ejaculation threshold.
       Having their partner mimic these techniques may allow them to ejaculate with their partner. 

       Finally, a stimulant  (eg Dexedrine 5-10mg) 1 hour before sexual activity may help. 
       If this approach is effective, one should consider screening for ADHD.

     Plan:
       {{pp}} self refer to counselling
       {{pp}} trial a medication switch to vilazodone (Viibryd) vortioxetine (Trintellix)  duloxetine (Cymbalta) levominacipran (Fetzima)]
       {{pp}} trial adding mirtazapine (Remeron) bupropion (Wellbutrin)
       {{pp}} trial dexedrine 5mg, taken one hour before sexual activity
       {{pp}} follow-up within 1 month regarding effectiveness of treatment, sooner if concerns
