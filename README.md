## Text-Expander for Medical Charting

With ever increasing demands on physician time, we need to make use of
technology to increase efficiency.
If we can spend less time on typing, we can spend more time listening
and caring for our patients.

Many electronic medical records (EMRs) provide the ability to create
templates or stamps.
Some of these functions actually work pretty well within each system.
However, they all require considerable investment in time to set up, and
collaboration on development is limited.
Templates may be shared within a clinic but seldom more widely.

Using a tool like espanso allows us to define templates/stamps and
automatic text expansion independent of any EMR.
This means you can document in a similar manner across different sites,
even if they are using different EMRs.  It also means a community of
interested individuals can collaborate to create a library that is
likely to be more complete and useful than anything any individual
can maintain on their own.
